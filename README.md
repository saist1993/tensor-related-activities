# tensor-related-activities
The aim is to implement Tensorlog:a differentiable deductive database by William Cohen. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06523)


This is a work in progress, with two parallel implementations, namely:
  - Python (using Theano)
  - Scala (using  Mxnet, and Apache Spark)

The documentation of the repo is still in the making. Meanwhile, please refer to [the project report](https://github.com/saist1993/tensor-related-activities/blob/sansa-ready/Report.pdf) for temporary documentation.
This is what the system more or less looks like:
